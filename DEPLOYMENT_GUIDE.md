## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- A Windows PC (this guide is Windows-focused)
- Internet connection
- A GitHub account (free)
- A Netlify account (free)

## üîΩ Step 1: Download and Setup

### 1.1 Download the Project

2. Extract the ZIP file to a location like `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\rony-portfolio`
3. You should see folders like `src`, `public`, and files like `package.json`

### 1.2 Install Node.js
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Download the LTS version (recommended)
3. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
4. Restart your computer after installation

### 1.3 Verify Installation
1. Open Command Prompt (press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter)
2. Type `node --version` and press Enter
3. Type `npm --version` and press Enter
4. Both should show version numbers

```cmd
npm install
```
This will download all required packages (may take 2-5 minutes).

### 2.3 Start Development Server
```cmd
npm run dev
```
You should see a message like "Local: http://localhost:5173"

### 2.4 View Your Website
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to `http://localhost:5173`

4. Update your information (see DATA_UPDATE_GUIDE.md for details)
5. Save the file

### 3.2 Test Your Changes
1. Go back to your browser (http://localhost:5173)

   ```

## üîß Step 4: Prepare for Deployment

### 4.1 Build the Website
1. In Command Prompt, make sure you're in the project folder
2. Run the build command:
   ```cmd
   npm run build
   ```
3. This creates a `dist` folder with your website files

### 4.2 Test the Built Website
1. Install a simple server:
   ```cmd
   npm install -g serve
   ```
2. Serve the built website:
   ```cmd

3. Update color values (use hex codes like `#3b82f6`)
4. Test locally before deploying

### 8.2 Add New Sections
